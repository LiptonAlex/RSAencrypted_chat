# RSAencrypted_chat
It`s a realization of a simple encrypted chat using RSA and a local host server.

Written on Python 3.10.4

I have used libraries: socket, threadings, rsa.

All of your messages to someone will be encrypted by RSA.

When starting the program- you must choose whether you're a host or you're a client.

Don't forget to swap the ip addresses in code from mine to yours.
